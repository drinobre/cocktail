## Objective

Create a single page APP where users can search for a specific drink from an API and the result will be display on the screen.

<!-- <img alt="plan" src="/cocktail_api/src/images/API_MVP.png" /> // Not working -->

## Technical requirements

I will be using React to fetch the API.

## Components Tree

- App
  -- Search
  -- Display

## Implementation Plan

### Initiate React and Structure Folder convention

- Init React (npx create-react-app <react-app-name>)
- Create the folder Components > App and add the app files automatically created by React
- Change the file location for APP and image in the import
- Test the APP (npm start)

### Creating components

- Create separate folders for each component, which will be rendered on the main APP (for example, buttons, display)
- Create the index.js file into each component, which they will handle a function containing a return in JSX format.
  Note: the return must be inside a <div> or <> tag

## Challenges / Lernings

- How to save an image on README file (format SVG or add the image on File)
